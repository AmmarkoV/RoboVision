Please note that this part of the code is a stub..!
A couple of years I go I wrote a very nice wumpus AI which should be the base for the functionality I am looking for 
http://ammar.gr/legacy/Wumpus.tar.gz , unfortunately I dont have the time to modify it for 
guarddog .. I hope I will find time to do so in the near future..
Commands that cannot be "analyzed" by this library could also be patched through to OpenMind , Wolfram Alpha and also
be kept on a local answer repository for future use..
