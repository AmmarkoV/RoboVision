This folder upon installation should be copied to /robot/
It is split in two , one part residing in a 64M tmpfs and one residing in the hard drive 
The data on the tmpfs ( or memfs )  is where frequent read/write operations occur in order to make operations faster and not waste the read/write cycles of the flash medium that guarddog runs on..
The data on the permfs is permanent and it carries all the state of the robot..

All the parts of the guarddog stack should reside in the /robot/ dir so , removing the /robot/ directory and the two robovision binaries from the system should completely purge guarddog
