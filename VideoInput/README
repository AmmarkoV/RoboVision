This is a V4L2 C/C++ library! 
It also has a Tester app in the VideoInputTester dir
You can easily compile the project using Code::Blocks and openning the .cbp 

The binaries libVideoInput.a and VideoInputTester/bin/Debug/VideoInputTester are compiled for x64 architecture ( you can check it using "file libVideoInput.a" from your terminal )
Will add more to the readme file and the main lib to fix compatibility with V4L ( not only V4L2 devices )
