This Directory should contain libVideoInput.a and VideoInput.h

You can download and make them from

http://github.com/AmmarkoV/VideoInput/

I guess I will physically add them after a while or make a script to auto download them but for now beeing a different project means different repository even though RoboVision Uses them
