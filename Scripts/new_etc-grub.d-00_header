The grub header script should be manually changed from  

make_timeout ()
{
cat << EOF
if [ "\${recordfail}" = 1 ]; then
  set timeout=-1
else
  set timeout=${2}
fi
EOF
}


to 

make_timeout()
{
cat << EOF
set timeout=0
EOF
}

This will disable changing the timeout after a failed boot that can lead to all the subsequent boots failing in a headless machine..!
