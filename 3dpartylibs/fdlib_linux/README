Please note that all builds were optimized for Intel Pentium CPUs. If you would like to run it on a different platform, or have any other questions, please let me know. 



I dont own the library , I havent written it..

It was made by  W. Kienzle, G. Bakir, M. Franz and B. Scholkopf , it just happens to be written really nicely and so I`ve made a wrapper on my VisualCortex for it..

If someone of the original team does not like it to be here , you can tell me to remove it..
The main reason for it beeing here is to make Guarddog compiling easier..!
