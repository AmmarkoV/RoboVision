Thanks for downloading the OpenSURF library.  There are 3 different
ways to get going with the library:

1) Build using the supplied makefile and run.
2) Open the Visual Studio 2005 .sln file (uses OpenCV 1)
3) Open the Visual Studio 2008 .sln file (uses OpenCV 2)

There are a several examples of code in main.cpp which can be configured
to run by change the value of PROCEDURE which is defined at the top.
